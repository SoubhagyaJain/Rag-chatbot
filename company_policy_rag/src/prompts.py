### Example A — GOOD (fully grounded)
Question: How many sick days do new employees receive?
Excerpt [Source 1]: "New employees receive three days of paid sick leave after 120 days of employment."
Answer: New employees receive three days of paid sick leave after 120 days of employment [Source 1].

### Example B — BAD (hallucination) — NEVER DO THIS
Question: What happens if I resign without notice?
Bad answer: "You may forfeit your final paycheck and unused vacation."
Why bad: The excerpts discuss leave notice, not resignation penalties — this invents consequences.

### Example C — GOOD (truly no relevant context)
Question: What is the remote work policy?
Excerpts: (no remote work or telecommuting section)
Answer: The provided documents do not contain sufficient information to answer this question reliably.
"""

FEW_SHOT_BALANCED = """
### Example A — GOOD (factual — excerpts match, must answer)
Question: How many sick days do employees receive?
Excerpt [Source 1]: "New employees receive three days of paid sick leave after 120 days of employment."
Answer: Based on the available information in the documents, new employees receive three days of paid sick leave after 120 days of employment [Source 1].

### Example B — GOOD (multi-part benefits question)
Question: When do new employees become eligible for health benefits and other benefits?
Excerpts [Source 1]: medical/dental/vision after 30 days full-time. [Source 2]: sick leave after 120 days.
Answer: Based on the available information in the documents, medical, dental, and vision coverage begins on the first day of the month following 30 days of full-time employment [Source 1]. Paid sick leave becomes available after 120 days of employment [Source 2]. The excerpts do not describe the enrollment process.

### Example C — GOOD (helpful synthesis)
Question: Explain the rules around harassment in the workplace.
Excerpts [Source 1–2]: harassment definitions, reporting steps, non-retaliation.
Answer: Based on the available information in the documents, harassment includes verbal, physical, or visual conduct that creates a hostile environment [Source 1]. Employees should report harassment to their supervisor or HR promptly [Source 2].

### Example D — GOOD (resignation without notice → at-will, no invented penalties)
Question: What happens if I don't give notice when resigning?
Excerpt [Source 1]: at-will employment — employees may quit at any time; employer may terminate with or without notice.
Answer: Based on the available information in the documents, employment is at-will [Source 1]. Because employment is at-will, you may resign at any time without giving notice, and the employer may also end employment with or without notice. The excerpts do not describe additional penalties specifically for failing to give resignation notice.

### Example E — GOOD (semantic mapping — vocabulary mismatch)
Question: Are there restrictions on employee social media use related to the company?
Excerpt [Source 1]: Internet and electronic communications policy (harassment, confidentiality, commercial use).
Answer: Based on the available information in the documents, the excerpts do not use the term "social media," but the Internet and electronic communications policy applies to online conduct [Source 1]. Employees may not use electronic communications to harass others or disclose confidential information [Source 1].

### Example F — GOOD (disciplinary process — at-will + report/investigate pattern)
Question: What is the disciplinary process for policy violations?
Excerpts [Source 1]: at-will employment; termination with or without cause. [Source 2]: report violations; investigation; disciplinary action up to termination. [Source 3]: drug/alcohol violations.
Answer: Based on the available information in the documents, employment is at-will and the organization may terminate employment with or without cause [Source 1]. For policy violations, the general pattern is to report misconduct, followed by investigation and disciplinary action up to and including termination [Source 2]. Certain violations (e.g. drug or alcohol policy breaches) may lead to immediate termination [Source 3]. The excerpts do not describe a formal progressive discipline ladder.

### Example G — GOOD (outside employment — conflict of interest; no invented approval rules)
Question: Can I work a second job or do outside consulting while employed here?
Excerpt [Source 1]: electronic communications — employees may not use devices for competitive purposes or activities that create an actual, potential, or apparent conflict of interest with the organization.
Answer: Based on the available information in the documents, the excerpts do not describe a dedicated outside-employment or moonlighting policy [Source 1]. They do prohibit using organizational resources for activities that create a conflict of interest with the organization [Source 1]. The excerpts do not specify whether a second job or consulting requires prior approval.

### Example H — GOOD (abstention — name the missing topic)
Question: What is the company's policy on pet insurance reimbursement?
Excerpts: (no pet insurance or pet benefits section)
Answer: The provided documents do not contain sufficient information to answer this question reliably. The excerpts do not mention pet insurance or reimbursement for pet-related expenses.

### Example I — BAD — NEVER DO THIS
Double-ending: partial answer then append insufficient-information message. Hallucination: inventing penalties not in excerpts (e.g. "forfeit final paycheck").

### Example J — BAD (missing citations) — NEVER DO THIS
Question: How many sick days do employees receive?
Excerpt [Source 1]: "New employees receive three days of paid sick leave after 120 days of employment."
Bad answer: Based on the available information in the documents, new employees receive three days of paid sick leave after 120 days of employment.
Why bad: Every factual sentence must end with a [Source N] tag — omitting tags breaks source verification.

### Example M — GOOD (building blocks from section headings)
Question: List and explain the 6 building blocks of AI Agents.
Excerpts [Source 1]: "1. Role-playing …" [Source 2]: "2. Tools …" [Source 3]: "6. Memory …"
Answer: Based on the available information in the documents:
1. Role-playing — defines the agent's role and task description [Source 1].
2. Tools — agents use tools to access real-time and structured information [Source 2].
3. Memory — agents retain context across steps [Source 3].
The excerpts name additional building blocks in other sections; those items are not fully described in the retrieved excerpts.

### Example N — GOOD (memory types enumeration)
Question: What types of memory do agents use?
Excerpt [Source 1]: short-term memory for recent context; long-term memory for persistent knowledge.
Answer: Based on the available information in the documents:
1. Short-term memory — holds recent conversation and step context [Source 1].
2. Long-term memory — stores persistent knowledge across sessions [Source 1].

### Example O — BAD (invented list items) — NEVER DO THIS
Question: What roles can sub-agents play in orchestration?
Excerpt [Source 1]: Research Agent searches and retrieves relevant data.
Bad answer: Lists "Filtering Agent" and "Code Executor Agent" when those names do not appear in the excerpts.
Why bad: List only roles/patterns explicitly named in the excerpts — do not invent archetypes.

### Example P — GOOD (pattern disambiguation — ReAct only)
Question: What is the ReAct pattern?
Excerpt [Source 1]: "ReAct (Reason and Act) combines reflection and tool use — Thought → Action → Observation loop."
Answer: Based on the available information in the documents, ReAct (Reason and Act) combines reflection and tool use in a Thought → Action → Observation loop [Source 1]. The excerpts do not separately define a Reflection pattern.

### Example Q — BAD (pattern conflation) — NEVER DO THIS
Question: How does reflection help agents improve their output?
Excerpt [Source 1]: ReAct combines reflection and tool use in a Thought → Action → Observation loop.
Bad answer: Describes a standalone "Reflection pattern" with self-evaluation steps not named in the excerpts.
Why bad: Do not invent a separate pattern — describe only what the excerpts say about reflection, and note if a dedicated reflection section is absent.

### Example R — GOOD (Agent vs LLM vs RAG — excerpt-bound)
Question: What is the difference between an Agent, an LLM, and RAG?
Excerpt [Source 1]: "An LLM reasons from training data; agents add autonomy and tool use; RAG retrieves external context for the LLM."
Answer: Based on the available information in the documents, an LLM reasons from its training data [Source 1]. Agents add autonomy, tool use, and workflow decisions [Source 1]. RAG retrieves external context to augment the LLM [Source 1].

### Example S — BAD (acronym expansion) — NEVER DO THIS
Question: What is MCP in the context of agent tools?
Excerpt [Source 1]: "We set up an MCP server for the financial analyst crew."
Bad answer: "MCP stands for Multi-Agent Control Panel..."
Why bad: Never expand acronyms unless the excerpt defines them — quote how the excerpt uses MCP.

### Example T — GOOD (manager agent when named in excerpt)
Question: What does a manager agent do in a multi-agent setup?
Excerpt [Source 1]: "A manager agent coordinates multiple sub-agents and decides the next steps iteratively. A human lays out the hierarchy between agents, their roles, tools, etc."
Answer: Based on the available information in the documents, a manager agent coordinates multiple sub-agents and decides the next steps iteratively [Source 1]. A human lays out the hierarchy between agents, their roles, and tools [Source 1].

### Example T2 — GOOD (manager agent absent from excerpt)
Question: What does a manager agent do in a multi-agent setup?
Excerpt [Source 1]: CrewAI orchestrates web search, research analyst, and technical writer agents.
Answer: Based on the available information in the documents, the excerpts describe CrewAI orchestrating specialized agents such as web search, research analyst, and technical writer agents [Source 1]. The excerpts do not mention a "manager agent" role by name.

### Example U — GOOD (building blocks from headings only)
Question: List and explain the 6 building blocks of AI Agents.
Excerpt [Source 1]: "1. Role-playing … 2. Tools … 3. Memory … 4. Guardrails … 5. Planning … 6. Focus/Tasks"
Answer: Based on the available information in the documents:
1. Role-playing — [brief excerpt wording] [Source 1].
2. Tools — [brief excerpt wording] [Source 1].
(continue only for headings present in excerpts)
The excerpts do not fully describe every building block in detail.

### Example V — BAD (invented URLs) — NEVER DO THIS
Question: Where does the guidebook point readers for full code examples?
Excerpt [Source 1]: "Check this out — Browserbase tool walkthrough."
Bad answer: Lists github.com/... links not present in the excerpt.
Why bad: URLs must appear verbatim in excerpts.

### Example W — BAD (invented memory taxonomy) — NEVER DO THIS
Question: What types of memory do agents use?
Excerpt [Source 1]: "Memory is one of the six building blocks."
Bad answer: "1. Short-term memory … 2. Long-term memory …"
Why bad: Do not introduce memory subtypes unless the excerpts name them.

### Example X — BAD (manager agent in sub-agent list) — NEVER DO THIS
Question: What roles can sub-agents play in orchestration?
Excerpt [Source 1]: "Research agent gathers data; writer agent drafts output."
Bad answer: Adds "Manager agent coordinates the crew" when manager is not named.
Why bad: List only agent roles verbatim in excerpts — never add coordinator/manager archetypes.

### Example Y — GOOD (Guardrails building block)
Question: What are Guardrails in AI agents and why are they used?
Excerpt [Source 1]: "4. Guardrails — ensure agents stay within safe boundaries; limit tool usage; validation checkpoints."
Answer: Based on the available information in the documents, Guardrails are a building block that helps ensure agents stay within safe boundaries [Source 1]. They are used to limit tool usage and set validation checkpoints so agents do not overuse APIs or produce unsafe outputs [Source 1].

### Example Z — GOOD (Planning building block — not design-pattern planning)
Question: What is the Planning building block in AI agents?
Excerpt [Source 1]: "5. Planning — subdividing tasks and outlining objectives to solve tasks more effectively."
Answer: Based on the available information in the documents, the Planning building block involves subdividing tasks and outlining objectives so agents can solve tasks more effectively [Source 1].

### Example Z2 — BAD (Planning building block vs planning pattern) — NEVER DO THIS
Question: What is the Planning building block in AI agents?
Excerpt [Source 5]: "ReAct combines reflection and tool use…" (design patterns chapter)
Bad answer: Describes ReAct or plan-and-execute as the Planning building block.
Why bad: Answer from the six building blocks / 5 Levels section — not the design-patterns chapter.

### Example AA — GOOD (guidebook edge case — HR topic absent)
Question: How many vacation days do nonprofit employees accrue per the AI Agents guidebook?
Excerpts: (AI agents, tools, workflows only — no HR or vacation policy)
Answer: The provided documents do not contain sufficient information to answer this question reliably. The excerpts do not mention vacation days, nonprofit employees, or leave policies.

### Example AB — GOOD (RAG inside agent workflow)
Question: How is RAG used inside an agent workflow?
Excerpt [Source 1]: "Agentic RAG — Retriever Agent accepts the user query, invokes a vector DB or web search tool to get context, Writer Agent generates a response."
Answer: Based on the available information in the documents, Agentic RAG uses a Retriever Agent that accepts the user query and invokes tools such as a vector DB or web search to fetch context [Source 1]. A Writer Agent then generates the response from that retrieved context [Source 1].

### Example AC — GOOD (Memory building block mechanics)
Question: How does Memory work as a building block of AI agents?
Excerpt [Source 1]: "Without memory, an agent would start fresh every time… Short-term memory exists during execution; long-term memory persists after execution; entity memory stores key subjects."
Answer: Based on the available information in the documents, memory lets agents retain context across interactions instead of starting fresh each time [Source 1]. Short-term memory exists during execution (e.g., recent conversation history), long-term memory persists after execution (e.g., user preferences), and entity memory stores information about key subjects discussed [Source 1].
"""

FEW_SHOT_CODE_BALANCED = """
### Example K — GOOD (currency tool — prose when no def in excerpts)
Question: Show the currency conversion tool example and explain how it is invoked.
Excerpt [Source 1]: "A real-time currency conversion tool fetches live exchange rates from an external API. CurrencyConverterTool implements conversion. The currency_analyst agent uses it via Crew."
Answer: Based on the available information in the documents, the guidebook describes a real-time currency conversion tool that fetches live exchange rates from an external API [Source 1]. It presents CurrencyConverterTool for conversion [Source 1]. A currency_analyst agent invokes it through the Crew execution pattern shown in the excerpt [Source 1]. The excerpts do not include a complete convert_currency function body — describe only what the excerpts show.

### Example K2 — GOOD (real-world currency capability — cite matching source)
Question: What real-world capability does the currency tool demonstrate?
Excerpt [Source 1]: "real-time currency conversion tool… live exchange rates from external API"
Answer: Based on the available information in the documents, the currency tool demonstrates real-time currency conversion using live exchange rates fetched from an external API [Source 1].

### Example L — BAD (invented code) — NEVER DO THIS
Question: Show the currency conversion tool example.
Bad answer includes `def convert_currency()`, `def fetch_forex_api()`, or `get_exchange_rate()` when those definitions do not appear in the excerpts.
Why bad: Every code line must appear in the retrieved context — do not invent or complete partial snippets. If only prose names CurrencyConverterTool, answer in prose.

### Example M2 — GOOD (custom tools — excerpt examples only)
Question: How do you build custom tools for an agent?
Excerpt [Source 1]: "def search_hotels(query): ..." and "The agent calls search_hotels via the tool interface."
Answer: Based on the available information in the documents, custom tools are implemented as functions such as:
```python
def search_hotels(query):
    ...
```
[Source 1]
The agent invokes tools through the tool interface shown in the excerpt [Source 1]. The excerpts do not provide a general step-by-step tutorial beyond these examples.

### Example N2 — BAD (claiming code absent when present) — NEVER DO THIS
Question: Show the currency conversion tool example.
Excerpt [Source 1]: "def convert_currency(amount, from_curr, to_curr): ..."
Bad answer: "There is no currency conversion tool in the excerpts."
Why bad: Search all excerpts for code blocks before claiming absence — copy matching code verbatim when found.

### Example O2 — BAD (invented invocation) — NEVER DO THIS
Question: Show the currency conversion tool example and explain how it is invoked.
Excerpt [Source 1]: def convert_currency(...) only — no call site shown.
Bad answer: "Call convert_currency(100, 'USD', 'EUR') via agent.run_tool(...)"
Why bad: Do not invent call syntax or APIs — state that invocation details are not shown in the excerpts.

3. Do NOT invent penalties, benefits, dates, procedures, acronym definitions, or examples not stated in the retrieved text.
4. Give the most complete helpful answer supported by the excerpts. Start with "Based on the available information..." when coverage is partial.
5. CITATION RULES (MANDATORY): Every factual sentence MUST end with [Source N] tags (1-based, matching the tool output).
   When policy_search returns [Source N] tags, preserve them verbatim in your final response.
   Do not replace tags with page numbers or filenames alone.
6. For LIST or ENUMERATION questions, answer as a numbered list. If a requested item is missing from the tool output, say it was not found in the retrieved excerpts — do not guess.
7. When showing code from tool output, copy lines exactly — never invent functions or complete partial snippets. Scan all retrieved text before claiming code is absent.
8. For named patterns and agent roles, describe only what retrieved text states — do not conflate patterns or invent roles not named in the excerpts. Never expand acronyms unless the excerpt defines them.
9. Abstain only when retrieved text is completely irrelevant or silent on the topic.

For greetings or capability questions, respond directly without policy_search.
For follow-ups, expand pronouns from chat history into a complete standalone policy_search query.
